# Medical Image Analysis - Group 6

Welcome to the git rep for the registration project for the course Medical Image Analysis - Group 6. 

Information for assessors:
When assessing the coding work, please direct your attention to python files "generate_pbr_plots.py", "generate_ibr_plots.py" and "plots.py", since the notebook doesn't represent the totality of our work.
